> Every AI-written git diff becomes a verified Aha lesson — with code-linked evidence, active-recall quizzes, spaced review, and a self-improving quality ratchet.

## What it is

**AhaDiff** is a **local-first learning layer for AI coding**.

It's not a PR summary, not a repo wiki, not yet another "code explainer." It reads every git diff and turns the change into:

- A **lesson** with `file:line` evidence chains
- A **claims** ledger where every assertion traces back to a hunk
- A comparable **quality score history** (ratcheted; `review.sqlite` is the single source of truth, `results.tsv` is a human-readable export)

The current code already ships Lesson / Claims / Quiz / Cards / Score / Ratchet. The review-flow SRS runtime and Viewer are still in later stages.

> Code Wiki explains a repo. AhaDiff teaches you what changed — and verifies every claim against the diff.

## Why

AI writes code faster, but developers know less about what they actually understood. "Vibe coding" sprints ahead; humans need to come back:

1. **AI ships, the understanding has to come back to humans** — a commit message isn't enough.
2. **Every claim must have evidence** — no hallucinated functions, no fabricated causality.
3. **Knowledge should compound** — when the same concept is touched again, the wiki should record evolution and backlinks.
4. **Quality should be comparable** — replace "looks fine" with an immutable evaluation bundle and a git ratchet.

## Core Philosophy (N-File Contract)

Extends the Karpathy / autoresearch three-file contract into an N-file variant:

| File | Who edits | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `program.md` | Human | Natural-language state machine for the improve loop |
| evaluation bundle | **Immutable** | `evaluator.py` + `rubric.py` + `rubric.yaml` + `gates.py` + `deterministic.py` (5 files, locked as a unit) |
| `prompts/*.md` | Agent | The only writable surface — a directory of prompts (agent edits prompts, never user code) |

LOOP: edit → commit → evaluate → keep if better, reset if worse → write to `review.sqlite` (single source of truth; `results.tsv` is an export view).

## Quickstart (Planned)

```bash
pipx install ahadiff

# Learn the last commit
ahadiff learn HEAD~1..HEAD

# Learn staged changes
ahadiff learn --staged

# Plan-then-implement-then-learn loop
ahadiff plan "add OAuth login"
ahadiff learn HEAD~1..HEAD --against .ahadiff/specs/oauth-login/SPEC.md

# Review
ahadiff quiz abc123
ahadiff review

# Interactive browser UI (Quiz/SRS/Dashboard)
ahadiff serve

# Ratcheted self-improvement
ahadiff improve abc123 --rounds 6

# Install into your AI tool (v0.1: 4 core CLI targets)
ahadiff install claude    # Claude Code → .claude/skills/
ahadiff install codex     # Codex CLI → AGENTS.md

## 8-Dimension Rubric

| # | Dimension | Weight | Hard gate |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Accuracy | 20 | < 14 → FAIL |
| 2 | Evidence | 18 | < 12 → FAIL |
| 3 | Diff Coverage | 14 | — |
| 4 | Learnability | 14 | — |
| 5 | Quiz Transfer | 10 | — |
| 6 | Spec Alignment | 10 | — |
| 7 | Conciseness | 8 | — |
| 8 | Safety & Privacy | 6 | Critical → FAIL |

Three verdicts: **PASS** ≥ 80 / **CAUTION** 60–80 / **FAIL** < 60.

## Status

**Stage 1 Task 1/2, Layer 1.5 / Task 7, Stage 2 / Task 5/6/8, and Stage 3 / Task 8.5/9/10/11/12 are now landed.** The current codebase already has:

- the `ahadiff learn` main path for git and non-git capture (`--patch` / `--compare`), followed by learnability gating, `claims.raw.jsonl -> claims.jsonl`, and full / hint / compact lesson output
- `ahadiff quiz` for a minimal interactive quiz loop backed by `quiz.jsonl`, with source-claim and file-line evidence printed back to the user
- `cards.jsonl` / `concepts.jsonl`: cards are generated for scored PASS / CAUTION runs; git-backed runs write the repo-global `concepts.jsonl`, while non-git runs write `concepts_local.jsonl`
- `ahadiff score`, `ahadiff verify`, and `ahadiff export-results`, backed by `review.sqlite` as the single source of truth and `results.tsv` as an export view
- `src/ahadiff/eval/{rubric,gates,deterministic,evaluator,results,ratchet}.py` for the 8-dimension scorer, hard gates, result persistence, ratchet selection, and export rebuilds
- runtime resource lookup that works in both source checkout and installed wheel mode for `eval_bundle_version`, `prompt_version`, and packaged lesson prompts
- `ahadiff review` / `ahadiff serve` / `ahadiff improve` / `ahadiff install` are still later-stage commands; the matching roadmap examples above are not available in the current CLI yet

This round also closed several runtime edges: `prompt_version` still tracks AhaDiff's own prompt resources instead of any target-workspace `prompts/`; lesson JSON parsing skips schema-mismatched example blocks before accepting a real answer; the lesson/quiz chain is now wired into `learn`; lesson-generation failures now clean up newly written `claims.raw.jsonl` / `claims.jsonl`, `quiz/`, and `concepts_local.jsonl` half-artifacts; successful `learn` runs now write a `learn` event plus `score.json`; manual `score` / `verify` still do not contaminate the learn baseline; `ReviewCard` now validates `last_rating` and `card_state/stale_reason`; fake quiz artifacts no longer pass as a complete Stage-3 result.

Current minimal verification:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/unit -q
source .venv/bin/activate && ruff check src tests
source .venv/bin/activate && ruff format --check src tests
source .venv/bin/activate && pyright
source .venv/bin/activate && uv build --wheel
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ahadiff quiz --help
```

Actual result from this session: `source .venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/unit -q` finished with `335 passed`; `source .venv/bin/activate && ruff check src tests`, `source .venv/bin/activate && ruff format --check src tests`, `source .venv/bin/activate && pyright`, and `source .venv/bin/activate && uv build --wheel` all passed. This session also included a clean-room wheel check: after installing the newly built wheel into a temporary virtualenv, installed-mode `evaluate_run()`, `compute_prompt_version()`, lesson/quiz prompt loading, lesson JSON parsing, and `compute_term_key()` all worked, and a target workspace `prompts/` directory still did not pollute `prompt_version`.

Roadmap:

- [ ] `v0.1` (MVP): CLI + Lesson + Evaluator + Ratchet end-to-end + React 19 WebUI (`ahadiff serve`) + 8 LLM Providers + 8 diff capture modes (incl. --unstaged / git show) + 4 CLI install targets + i18n + stage gates
- [ ] `v0.2`: --compare-dir + --patch-url + 7 IDE install targets + watchdog incremental regeneration + section-level helpfulness + Team features
- [ ] `v1.0`: PWA + public benchmark suite

## Inspirations

- **karpathy/autoresearch** — N-file contract (three-file variant) + git ratchet
- **alchaincyf/darwin-skill** — 8-dimension rubric + Phase 2.5 rewrite
- **Evol-ai/SkillCompass** — PASS/CAUTION/FAIL + weakest-dimension-first
- **ZJU-REAL/SkillZero** — helpfulness-driven retention + compact context
- **safishamsi/graphify** — repo-level graph overlay
- **karpathy/llm-wiki** gist — persistent compounding wiki

## Design Axioms

1. **Evidence first** — every claim must trace back to `file:line`
2. **Learning over summary** — quizzes and review beat pretty summaries
3. **Local-first trust** — three privacy tiers (`strict_local` / `redacted_remote` / `explicit_remote`), defaults to `strict_local`
4. **Paper-like seriousness** — academic feel; no cool-purple SaaS gradients
5. **One accent per style** — warm paper background + a single accent color
