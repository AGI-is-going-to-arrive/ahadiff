## What it is

**AhaDiff** is a **local-first learning layer for AI coding**.

It's not a PR summary, not a repo wiki, not yet another "code explainer." It reads every git diff and turns the change into:

- A **lesson** with `file:line` evidence chains
- A **claims** ledger where every assertion traces back to a hunk
- A comparable **quality score history** (ratcheted; `review.sqlite` is the single source of truth, `results.tsv` is a human-readable export)

The main line from Stage 0 / Task 0 through Stage 6 now has real shipped artifacts, and Stage 7 i18n signoff has also passed. The current code already ships Lesson / Claims / Quiz / Misconception Cards / Cards / Score / Ratchet. The review-flow SRS runtime, serve backend, install targets, GitHub Action templates, benchmark suite, improve-loop core, Task 17 targeted verification, Phase 2.5 runtime, i18n-0 backend, and the `viewer/` React SPA are all landed. The v0.1 frontend delivered Dashboard / Lesson / Diff / Quiz / ConceptGraph and went through R1-R5 five-round cross-model adversarial review (51 real findings fixed). v0.2 backend Gates 0-6 + frontend Phase 1-4 have all passed review; the current branch also lands section-level helpfulness / learning transfer, misconception cards, Graphify backend foundations plus some deeper pieces (parser / matcher / linker / slicer / search / freshness / `/api/graph/status`, still backend-only partial rather than full Graphify provenance / UI integration), watch mode (`ahadiff watch` / `serve --watch` / `/api/watch/status`), the mid-tier serve APIs (`/api/search`, `/api/usage`, `/api/audit`, `/api/review/mastery`, `/api/concepts/weak`, `/api/spec/alignment`, `/api/stats/learning`), a low-level task-status surface, and repo-level CI/CD gates (PR unit+pinned + Windows runtime guard + nightly-eval + release coverage gate). This backend-closure round also locks down the learn publish boundary, watcher restart/status behavior, concepts DB/JSONL cursors, public search rank ordering, and the frontend-facing auth-token bootstrap contract. The earlier serve token bootstrap, thread-backed learn cancellation/shutdown, empty public IDs in DTOs, non-finite FSRS values, and proxy-trace hardening remain in place. The frontend remains at 12 pages ~30 components, 201/201 i18n key parity, 780 green Playwright runs, and the latest `pnpm run build` output is 302.83 KB (92.67 KB gzip).

> Code Wiki explains a repo. AhaDiff teaches you what changed — and verifies every claim against the diff.

## Why

AI writes code faster, but developers know less about what they actually understood. "Vibe coding" sprints ahead; humans need to come back:

1. **AI ships, the understanding has to come back to humans** — a commit message isn't enough.
2. **Every claim must have evidence** — no hallucinated functions, no fabricated causality.
3. **Knowledge should compound** — when the same concept is touched again, the wiki should record evolution and backlinks.
4. **Quality should be comparable** — replace "looks fine" with an immutable evaluation bundle and a git ratchet.

## Core Philosophy (N-File Contract)

Extends the Karpathy / autoresearch three-file contract into an N-file variant:

| File | Who edits | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `program.md` | Human | Natural-language state machine for the improve loop |
| evaluation bundle | **Immutable** | `evaluator.py` + `rubric.py` + `rubric.yaml` + `gates.py` + `deterministic.py` (5 files, locked as a unit) |
| `prompts/*.md` | Agent | The only writable surface — a directory of prompts (agent edits prompts, never user code) |

LOOP: edit → commit → evaluate → keep if better, reset if worse → write to `review.sqlite` (single source of truth; `results.tsv` is an export view).

## Status

**Stage 0 / Task 0, Stage 1 Task 1/2, Layer 1.5 / Task 7, Stage 2 / Task 5/6/8, Stage 3 / Task 8.5/9/10/11/12, Stage 4 / Task 15, Stage 5 / Task 16/17, Stage 6 / Task 18/19/20, and the i18n-0 backend are now landed.** The current codebase already has:

- the `ahadiff learn` main path for git and non-git capture (`--patch` / `--compare`), followed by learnability gating, `claims.raw.jsonl -> claims.jsonl`, and full / hint / compact lesson output
- `ahadiff quiz` for a minimal interactive quiz loop backed by `quiz.jsonl`, with source-claim and file-line evidence printed back to the user
- the quiz artifact chain writes both `quiz.jsonl` and `misconception_cards.jsonl`; scored PASS / CAUTION runs generate `cards.jsonl` and backfill `review_card_id`, while open-answer rows without `review_card_id` still render correctly in the viewer; git-backed runs write the repo-global `concepts.jsonl`, while non-git runs write `concepts_local.jsonl`
- `ahadiff score`, `ahadiff verify`, and `ahadiff export-results`, backed by `review.sqlite` as the single source of truth and `results.tsv` as an export view
- `ahadiff review`, `ahadiff mark <claim_id> wrong`, and `ahadiff db {backup,restore,check,import-results,finalize-targeted}` for the landed review.sqlite review / signals / result-events / lossy-import / targeted-finalize path
- `ahadiff serve`: the localhost-only serve backend is available. Read routes expose finalized runs only; write routes require token plus Origin/Referer checks. `/api/auth/token` now requires a same-origin browser signal, keeps GET compatibility, and also supports POST bootstrap. The branch also adds `/api/search`, `/api/usage`, `/api/audit`, `/api/review/mastery`, `/api/concepts/weak`, `/api/spec/alignment`, `/api/stats/learning`, `/api/graph/status`, `POST /api/learn`, and `/api/watch/status`; the current route surface is 42 concrete `/api` Route objects plus 1 `/api` catchall (`Route(` total = 44, with `/healthz` as the extra non-API route); `/api/tasks*` and `/api/watch/status` remain low-level, internal/unstable status/progress surfaces and are not stable public APIs
- `ahadiff install`: Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / hooks / GitHub Action targets are available. Hooks are POSIX-shell targets and are explicitly rejected on Windows in v0.1. Existing hook files are now read through no-follow regular-file checks, so symlink / reparse-point hook paths are rejected. Generated GitHub workflows cover macOS + Linux; Windows remains deferred. The generate workflow uses `AHADIFF_PROVIDER_API_KEY` and uploads `.ahadiff/` outputs as an artifact
- `ahadiff benchmark`: the local benchmark manifest, 20 eval fixtures, 10 pinned integration fixtures, and `ground_truth.md` consistency checks are available
- the repo also now ships repo-level Backend CI / `nightly-eval` / `release` workflows: PR runs unit + pinned integration (`ubuntu py311/py312 + macOS py312`) with a separate Windows runtime guard, and the release gate now blocks on `doctor`, wheel install smoke, and coverage `>= 85%`. `pyproject.toml` also now carries `watchdog` / `tree-sitter` optional extras and `pytest-cov` as a dev dependency; `ahadiff watch`, `serve --watch`, and `/api/watch/status` are landed, while `/api/watch/status` is still marked internal/unstable. `tree-sitter` is no longer just optional wiring: the runtime consumer is now connected at the symbol-extraction layer for JS/TS/TSX + Go + Java + Rust + PHP + Ruby + C#; Python stays AST-first, unsupported languages still fall back to regex / section header, and no downstream lesson / quiz / claims business logic changed
- The Phase 0 follow-up is now reflected in the branch: the contract authority, the `safe_sqlite_connect` SQLite connection helper, reparse/hardlink protections, serve CORS and `X-Frame-Options` headers, CLI cold start, and local baseline scripts all have matching implementation
- i18n-0: the locale resolver supports cookie / Accept-Language / CLI / config / `AHADIFF_LANG` / `LANG` fallback, and lesson/quiz prompt payloads carry the requested output-language instruction
- `ahadiff improve --suite local --rounds N`, which currently supports only `--suite local`. It selects a baseline from an existing finalized run, edits only an allowlisted prompt in a git worktree, replays the same diff, and rescores the candidate; the candidate must improve the target dimension plus `accuracy`, `evidence`, and `safety_privacy`, and hard gates must still pass. Passing candidates are cherry-picked back when possible and recorded as `event_type=improve` / `status=targeted_verify`; non-improving rounds are recorded as `discard`; cherry-pick conflicts leave a pending worktree without finalizing the run; two consecutive `discard` rounds in the same session trigger one Phase 2.5 worktree rewrite
- `src/ahadiff/eval/{rubric,gates,deterministic,evaluator,results,ratchet}.py` for the 8-dimension scorer, hard gates, result persistence, ratchet selection, and export rebuilds
- `src/ahadiff/review/{database,scheduler,schemas,signal}.py` for review.sqlite schema / migration, FSRS-6 scheduling, the review queue, learning signals, and the review CLI backend
- `src/ahadiff/improve/{loop,program,targeted,rewrite}.py` for improve sessions, the immutable improve_program prompt, worktree isolation, the 5 mutable-prompt allowlist, replay-learn, targeted verification, Phase 2.5 triggering, cherry-pick ordering, session validation, and pending-worktree resume guards
- runtime resource lookup that works in both source checkout and installed wheel mode for `eval_bundle_version`, `prompt_version`, and packaged lesson prompts
- `keep_final` is still a manual full 8-dimension recheck via `ahadiff db finalize-targeted <event_id>`; the improve loop does not auto-promote it. The `viewer/` React SPA is complete through Phase A-E with R1-R5 five-round cross-model deep review; v0.2 frontend Phase 1-4 adds 6 new pages (Review / Ratchet / Landing / Settings / Onboarding / Skills), 66 v6 design tokens, Skeleton loading component, review-store, per-route ErrorBoundary, shared utility extraction, i18n upgraded to 201/201 parity, and Playwright upgraded to 780 tests; the Quiz page now reads `misconception_cards.jsonl` and keeps open-answer rows without `review_card_id` renderable instead of routing them into SRS by mistake

This round also closed several runtime edges: `prompt_version` still tracks AhaDiff's own prompt resources instead of any target-workspace `prompts/`; lesson JSON parsing skips schema-mismatched example blocks before accepting a real answer; the lesson/quiz chain is now wired into `learn`; lesson-generation failures now clean up newly written `claims.raw.jsonl` / `claims.jsonl`, `quiz/`, and `concepts_local.jsonl` half-artifacts; successful `learn` runs now write a `learn` event plus `score.json`; manual `score` / `verify` still do not contaminate the learn baseline; `ReviewCard` now validates `last_rating` and `card_state/stale_reason`; fake quiz artifacts no longer pass as a complete Stage-3 result. The pinned integration fixture was also tightened after that: tests now write `symbols.json`, generate `cards.jsonl` through `generate_cards_for_run()`, and validate every row as `ReviewCard`, so hand-written partial cards can no longer bypass the production contract. Task 15 is also fully hardened in this round: legacy `cards` schemas now migrate `stale_reason` explicitly, schema-invalid `cards.jsonl` is downgraded to warnings, repeated regenerate runs no longer leave old active cards in the due queue, `regenerate --only quiz` restores the previous quiz/cards artifacts if `evaluate_run` fails and deletes stale `cards.jsonl` plus marks active cards `stale + staleness_unknown` on `FAIL`, lossy TSV import now runs as a single-connection whole-batch import with rollback on bad rows or duplicate identities, `rollback_result_event` now does delete + export-row selection in one connection, and a plain DB connect no longer creates parent directories silently on typo paths. Task 16/17 now covers the `lesson_hint.md` allowlist entry, session-id path validation, a 30-minute replay timeout, paired prompt temp+replace writes, non-conflict cherry-pick failure handling, no `finalized.json` for discard or pending-conflict runs, pending conflicts excluded from the next baseline, volatile staged/unstaged replay from the saved `patch.diff`, shorter worktree paths, a `--rounds` cap of 20, null-byte rejection, Ctrl+C after a completed round no longer appending a second crash event, targeted verification, one Phase 2.5 trigger per session, and OpenAI-compatible provider endpoint normalization. This cache-key hardening also closes the API-version boundary for LLM calls: different `api_family_version` values under the same `api_family` now produce different cache keys, so compatible gateways or API-version changes do not reuse stale results.

Current minimal verification:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/unit -q
source .venv/bin/activate && ruff check src tests
source .venv/bin/activate && pyright
source .venv/bin/activate && uv build --wheel
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ahadiff quiz --help
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ahadiff review --help
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ahadiff improve --help
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ahadiff db check --help
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m ahadiff install github-action --help
```

The live LLM judge smoke is opt-in. Its default model order is `gpt-5.3-codex-spark,gpt-5.4-mini`; each model tries OpenAI Responses before Chat Completions:

```bash
AHADIFF_LIVE_LLM_JUDGE=1 \
AHADIFF_LIVE_LLM_API_KEY="$AHADIFF_LIVE_LLM_API_KEY" \
AHADIFF_LIVE_LLM_BASE_URL="$AHADIFF_LIVE_LLM_BASE_URL" \
AHADIFF_LIVE_LLM_MODELS="gpt-5.3-codex-spark,gpt-5.4-mini" \
pytest tests/live/test_llm_judge_live.py -q
```

Latest verification (2026-04-30): `pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` = `1514 passed, 1 skipped`; `ruff check src tests` passed; `ruff format --check` passed for this round's touched files; `pyright` = `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 informations`. The full-tree `ruff format --check src tests` still has the pre-existing `src/ahadiff/graphify/parser.py` reformat drift; this round did not touch that file.

Roadmap:

- [ ] `v0.1` (MVP): CLI + Lesson + Evaluator + Ratchet end-to-end + React 19 WebUI (`ahadiff serve`) + 8 LLM Providers + 8 diff capture modes (incl. --unstaged / git show) + 6 install targets + i18n + stage gates
- [ ] `v0.2`: --compare-dir + --patch-url + 7 IDE install targets + watchdog incremental regeneration + section-level helpfulness + Team features (done: backend Gates 0-6 + medium APIs + helpfulness / learning transfer + misconception cards + Graphify backend foundations plus some deeper pieces + watch mode + frontend Phase 1-4 + 13 install targets + LLM cache + usage.sqlite; remaining: Team / deeper Graphify linking and the later V6 frontend pass)
- [ ] `v1.0`: PWA + public benchmark suite

## Inspirations

- **karpathy/autoresearch** — N-file contract (three-file variant) + git ratchet
- **alchaincyf/darwin-skill** — 8-dimension rubric + Phase 2.5 rewrite
- **Evol-ai/SkillCompass** — PASS/CAUTION/FAIL + weakest-dimension-first
- **ZJU-REAL/SkillZero** — helpfulness-driven retention + compact context
- **safishamsi/graphify** — repo-level graph overlay
- **karpathy/llm-wiki** gist — persistent compounding wiki

## Design Axioms

1. **Evidence first** — every claim must trace back to `file:line`
2. **Learning over summary** — quizzes and review beat pretty summaries
3. **Local-first trust** — three privacy tiers (`strict_local` / `redacted_remote` / `explicit_remote`), defaults to `strict_local`
4. **Paper-like seriousness** — academic feel; no cool-purple SaaS gradients
5. **One accent per style** — warm paper background + a single accent color
